## 🧠 Engineering Principles

This repository follows real-world backend engineering practices:

- Clean architecture over notebooks
- Observability first
- Reusable utilities
- Incremental production readiness
- Measurable performance (latency, logging, metrics)

---

## 🚀 Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Python & Backend Foundations
- Decorators & instrumentation
- Retry logic & error handling
- Async programming
- FastAPI services

### Phase 2 — Applied ML & NLP
- Embeddings & semantic search
- Vector databases
- Retrieval pipelines

### Phase 3 — Applied AI Systems
- RAG architectures
- Tool-calling agents
- Memory systems
- Multi-agent workflows

### Phase 4 — Production Engineering
- Deployment
- Monitoring
- System design
- Performance optimization
